#  About
This is a repository that I created for various bash scripts that I found to be very useful.  There is also the `xkcd` program that I created allowing you to download and view xkcd comics from the command line. 

## Usage 
I am currently working on a PPA for the xkcd program, but, for the time being the only way to install the program(s) is to either download the binary from the releases tab or to clone it. 

The only way to install the other scripts is to clone them or copy and paste the code. 

After you have installed them, open a new terminal window and type `chmod +x xkcd`. Obviously replace xkcd with the name of the program you want to use.

After that is done you will be able to start downloading using the following commands:
```sh
sh xkcd [-n comic number | -t comic title]
```
I plan to expand this repository to be much more useful. Hope you enjoy!
